## Usage
### Registration of user
Post request

    https://saniray.kz/auth/registration
With body 

    {
        "login": "<Your login>",
        "password": "<Your Password>"
    }

After successful registration user has the opportunity to login to his account
### Authorization of user
Post request

    https://saniray.kz/auth/login
With body 

    {
        "login": "<Your login>",
        "password": "<Your Password>"
    }
After successful authorization user will get his JWT token, which is available only during 1 hour

Response example:

    {
        "token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJhYSIsImV4cCI6MTc0MTExNDQ2Nn0.UehpmVybfx8HavHkPE0g_ZnssjJHWxkGcwBLUZcOPUM"
    }

### Websocket connection
For online chatting user must indicate get request to websocket with JWT token

    ws://saniray.kz/messages/ws?token=<JWT token>

After successfully connecting to the websocket, the user can send a message to an existing user in the database

    {
        "sender": "<Sender login>",
        "recipient": "<Recipient login>",
        "content": "Example Message"
    }

If the recipient is also connected to the web socket, he will receive the message, and during sending, all messages are saved to the database

### Getting all messages
Also user has the opportunity to read all history of messages
Get request

    https://saniray.kz//messages/old_messages

With header

    Authorization: Bearer <JWT token>
Example response:

    [
        {
            "sender": "azarenkov",
            "recipient": "aa",
            "content": "Hello from Postman!",
            "timestamp": 1741110925
        },
        {
            "sender": "aa",
            "recipient": "azarenkov",
            "content": "Hello from Postman!",
            "timestamp": 1741110932
        },
        {
